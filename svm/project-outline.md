# SVMs for fMRI data

## Aims:
1. Learn c++ design patterns and software engineering principles
2. Understand the mathematics behind support vector machines
3. Implement a development routine
4. Understand the physics behind fMRI
5. Increase in confidence when working with fMRI data

## Timeline:
### Preplanning:
- Read **papers** about SVMs
- Annotate foreign terminology and seek to understand
- Always look at the mathematical solutions
- Read example Python code
- Plan your software on paper
### Development:
- Try to follow design principles
- Branch out to understand more advanced solutions
- Increase familiarity with language and debugging
### Optimisation:
- Discussing code built with a more experienced developer
- Learning C++ optimisation
- Testing and documentation
